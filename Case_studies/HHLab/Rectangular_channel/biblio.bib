	abstract = {Shallow mixing layers (SMLs) behind a splitter plate were studied in a tilted rectangular open-channel ﬂume for a range of ﬂow depths and the initial shear parameter λ = (U2 − U1)/(U2 + U1), where U1 and U2 are streamwise velocities of the slow and fast streams, respectively. The main focus of the study is on (i) key parameters controlling the time-averaged SMLs; and (ii) the emergence and spatial development of Kelvin–Helmholtz coherent structures (KHCSs) and large- and very-large-scale motions (LSMs and VLSMs) and associated turbulence statistics. The time-averaged ﬂow features of the SMLs are mostly controlled by bed-friction length scale h/cf and shear parameter λ as well as by time-averaged spanwise velocities V and momentum ﬂuxes UV, where h and cf are ﬂow depth and bed-friction coefﬁcient, respectively. For all studied cases, the effect of shear layer turbulence on the SML growth is comparatively weak, as the ﬂuxes UV dominate over the spanwise turbulent ﬂuxes. Initially, the emergence of KHCSs and their length scales largely depend on λ. The KHCSs cannot form if λ 0.3 and the turbulence behind the splitter plate resembles that of free mixing layers. Further downstream, shear layer turbulence becomes dependent on the bed-friction number S = cf δv/(4hλ), where δv is vorticity thickness. When S 0.01, the KHCSs are longitudinally stretched and the scaled transverse turbulent ﬂuxes decrease with increasing S. The presence and streamwise development of LSMs/VLSMs away from the splitter plate depends on the λ-value, particularly when λ {\textgreater} 0.3, resembling LSMs/VLSMs in conventional open-channel ﬂows when λ is small.},
