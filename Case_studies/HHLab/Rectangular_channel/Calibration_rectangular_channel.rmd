# Experimental set up

A rectangular channel set up was used for this case study, this case never flows in floodplain. All the information about the case of study could be consulted here : the paper [Proust et al., (2022)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/shallow-mixing-layers-over-hydraulically-smooth-bottom-in-a-tilted-open-channel/1E7D46915C8BCD807E30C1F0B1E17225&ved=2ahUKEwj_0Oax162PAxUpNvsDHWKaDosQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2EI5uRyB-SEpsj14bvVBfI) and the numerical data [Dataset Proust et al., (2022)](https://doi.org/10.57745/EQURJN):

Here the features of the experiment:

- Length: 18 m 
- Width: 3 m 
- Slope : 1.04 x 10-3
- Material : glass, same friction everywhere
- Flow conditions : uniform flows with a total discharge of 14, 30, 60, 120 L/s  
- Water level measurements: 161 measures from 0.50 m to 16.50 m
