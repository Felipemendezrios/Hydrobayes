# Rhône with Ain tributary

## Bathymetry
Rhône bathymetry was obtained from Léa Kieffer in OSR6.
Ain tributary was composed in two parts:
From Port Galland (PGA) until the confluence with the Rhône, information was obtained from OSR6 with a reservoir compartment. 
Then, from PGA to Pont Chazey (PCH), digital elevation model (DEM) was used to get the cross sections and set up the model.

## Case
WSE at Rhone: discharge 750 m/s

## Simulation time period:
2010-02-21 13:00:00 to 2010-03-03 13:00:00

## Date of measurements:
2010-02-26 13:00:00 to 2010-02-26 13:00:00. Any time duration was reported, any lag time was considered to assign the dates.

First measurement at 432000 seconds from the beginning of the simulation. Last measurement at 432000 seconds.

# Boundary conditions:
- All data were taken from time series available either Hydroportail or OSR.
- Warn up necessary for this model is around 4-8 hours.
