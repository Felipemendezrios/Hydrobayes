# Rhône with Ain tributary

## Bathymetry
Rhône bathymetry was obtained from Léa Kieffer in OSR6.
Ain tributary was composed in two parts:
From Port Galland (PGA) until the confluence with the Rhône, information was obtained from OSR6 with a reservoir compartment. 
Then, from PGA to Pont Chazey (PCH), digital elevation model (DEM) was used to get the cross sections and set up the model.

## Case
WSE at Ain tributary : discharge 90 m/s

## Simulation time period:
2016-04-07 11:57:47 to 2016-04-17 13:38:01

## Date of measurements:
2016-04-12 11:57:47	to 2016-04-12 13:38:01
First measurement at 432000 seconds from the beginning of the simulation. Last measurement at 438014 seconds.

# Boundary conditions:
- All data were taken from time series available either Hydroportail or OSR.
- Warn up necessary for this model is around  4-6 hours.
