## Bathymetry

Ain tributary was composed in two parts:
From Port Galland (PGA) until the confluence with the Rhône, information was obtained from OSR6 with a reservoir compartment. 
Then, from PGA to Pont Chazey (PCH), digital elevation model (DEM) was used to get the cross sections and set up the model.
