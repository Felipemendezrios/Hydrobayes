# Synthetic case

This is a simple case of a confluence of two rectangular canals flowing only in the main channel without floodplain. 
The model will simulate water surface elevation (WSE), which will be used as the real observation of the synthetic data built using a specified spatial friction and boundary conditions. Two event will be computed to get these synthetic data.

This case introduces a multi-reach and multi-event scenario. 

Afterwards, degraded model will be proposed to get the model to be calibrated.

## Boundary conditions:
- Upstream MR: QdT with uniform flow of 0.10 m3/s
- Downstream MR: QdZ 
- Upstream TR: QdT with uniform flow of 0.07 m3/s
