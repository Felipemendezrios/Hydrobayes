Folders developement:
- run_model_BaM: it is the folder which we are working on.
This file contains events to test MAGE_ZQV model in BaM, but outside the BaM environment. In other words, I get only access to run_model function to run Mage Model.
The likelihood is calculated by myself, using some RBaM functions, but I can modify all that I want.
